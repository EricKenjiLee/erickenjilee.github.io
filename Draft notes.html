Although I absolutely loved learning (I would memorize the dictionary for fun as a kid), I was never a great student and
  in fact I was a rather poor one: I had something like a 2.8 GPA going into
  junior year of high school and let's not talk about how I did in math. That sort of all changed
  when I saw <a href="http://media.hhmi.org/hl/m/08Lect.html">this</a>
   lecture series by everyone's favorite bow-tied neuroscientist,
  Eric Kandel (pictured above with the author); I remember every day rushing to get home to view the day's new lecture
  and being so jealous of all the student's that got to be there to view it live. I
  didn't know anything about neuroscience back then (and neither did anyone else around me) but
  I knew I desperately wanted to be a part of it. I've had the good fortune to have discovered
  neuroscience so early and also to have had such a laser focus on it: there's never been a moment in
  the last decade in which I've more than entertained the notion of studying anything else. <br><br>
  I got my ass
  into gear and started going to summer school and registering for AP classes. I decided against
  attending a local community college and started looking at applying to mainland bachelor's programs.
  I also sought out
  opportunities where I could find them: I met with neurologists that I "interviewed" at the hospital where my mom was a secretary; taking a week off
   from school (with permission), I went to the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting in Honolulu
    and took in what little I could understand; they had no registration category for a lone
    high school student so they made me a badge out of a notecard and string. I applied to mainland
     colleges that had any semblance of a neuroscience program and ultimately ended up at the University of Puget Sound (UPS).
     It wasn't the biggest of colleges, or the most well-known, but they had a neuroscience lab (just one) and
     that was enough for me. <br><br>
  Jumping ahead four years, I ended up graduating with a B.S. in Biochemistry and Math and, very on-brand for me,
   I sacrificed my GPA for taking as many classes as I could ending up with 159 credit hours (1 shy of a double B.S.) but a 3.13 GPA. Yikes!
   I knew this and the three years of research experience I had wouldn't be enough for the sorts of
   graduate schools I wanted to attend so, although I was decided on a Ph.D. <br><br>

   Over the next three years, I did everything I could to remedy the above by joining the Brain Observatory team at
   the Allen Institute for Brain Science and also getting my masters in Applied Mathematics at the University of
   Washington.
