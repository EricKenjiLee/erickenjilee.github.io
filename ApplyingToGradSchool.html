    <p>First, a word of caution: this blog post, intended to be a living one, is
      only intended to be of use to those applying specifically to Ph.D. programs
      in neuroscience; if there's one thing I've learned, programs (even those
      ostensibly similar in discipline) differ <i>wildly</i> in their expectations and
      application processes. <i>Caveat emptor</i>.

     Applying to Ph.D. Programs in Neuroscience
   </h2>
    <p>
      Being back home in Hawaii, I've been afforded an indulgence that I so rarely (if ever)
      have had over the past eight years: to just sit, to just think. On the white sands
      of Kalama Beach (see banner photo), I took stock of the past year applying to
      graduate schools: what went wrong, what went right, and about what I would
      wish for others to know should the subject themselves to the same unsparing
      referendum of one’s scientific self-worth. Although I wasn’t a better applicant
      than others&#8212;mistakes were made that have since probably been overlearned
      from&#8212;what follows next is hopefully still of some use to others.<br><br>
      I also tried to think deeply about what I might offer given the already excellent
      contributions to the "Getting into Neuroscience Grad School" literature from others like
       <a href="https://lucyblogs.wordpress.com/2018/08/02/all-about-phd-applications/">Lucy Lai</a>,
       <a href="https://monicagatesblog.wordpress.com/2016/03/14/the-phd-application-post/">Vael Gates</a>, and
       <a href="https://oriolpavon.com/2016/12/22/tips-applying-for-a-phd/">Oriol Pav&#243;n</a> (each of whose
       blogposts I found to be immensely helpful in my own application process);
       I thought about what I could possibly add of value given that I've always been a
       relatively poor student, went to an undergrad few have heard of, and hadn't met
       an academic until college. But in this, I think, I might have some advice for
       those that find themselves in a similar situation and still desire to attend
        a good&#8212;even great&#8212;Ph.D. program in neuroscience. <br> <br>
        This post will be
        less prescriptive and more personal; it's meant to be an account of my
        experiences, failures and all, with as much honesty as possible.
        More bildungsroman, less how-to guide.

    <p>
    So I grew up in Hawai'i; great for poke, <i>terrible</i> for neuroscience. To date,
     I have yet to meet a single graduate student from my state; I do know a neuroscientist
      or two but, of course, they're from Punahou *<i>groan</i>*. I was never a great student,
      in fact I was a rather poor one: I had something like a 2.8 GPA going into
      junior year of high school and let's not talk about math. That sort of all changed
      when I saw [this] lecture series by everyone's favorite bow-tied neuroscientist,
      Eric Kandel; I remember every day rushing to get home to view the day's new lecture
      and being so jealous of all the student's that got to be there to view it live. I
      didn't know anything about neuroscience back then (and neither did anyone else around me) but
      I knew I desperately wanted to be a part of it. I've had the good fortune to have discovered
      neuroscience so early and also to have had such a laser focus on it: there's never been a moment in
      the last decade in which I've more than entertained the notion of studying anything else. <br><br>
      I got my ass
      into gear and started going to summer school and registering for AP classes. I decided against
      attending a local community college and started looking at applying to mainland bachelor's programs.
      I also sought out
      opportunities where I could find them: I met with neurologists, like Dr.
       Stuart Pang, that I "interviewed" at the hospital where my mom was a secretary; taking a week off
       from school (with permission), I went to the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting in Honolulu
        and took in what little I could understand&#8212;they had no registration category for a lone
        high school student so they made me a badge out of a notecard. I applied to mainland
         colleges that had any semblance of a neuroscience program and ultimately ended up at the University of Puget Sound.
