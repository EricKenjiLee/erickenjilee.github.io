    <p>First, a word of caution: this blog post, intended to be a living one, is
      only intended to be of use to those applying specifically to Ph.D. programs
      in neuroscience; something I learned in this process is it' that programs (even those
      ostensibly similar in discipline) differ <i>wildly</i> in their expectations and
      application processes. <i>Caveat emptor</i>.

    <p>
      Being back home in Hawaii, I've been afforded an indulgence that I so rarely (if ever)
      have had over the past eight years: to just sit, to just think. On the white sands
      of Kalama Beach (see banner photo), I took stock of the past year applying to
      graduate schools: what went wrong, what went right, and about what I would
      wish for others to know should the subject themselves to the same unsparing
      referendum of one’s scientific self-worth. Although I wasn’t a better applicant
      than others&#8212;mistakes were made that have since probably been overlearned
      from&#8212;what follows next is hopefully still of some use to others.<br><br>
      I tried to think deeply about what I might offer given the already excellent
      contributions to the "Getting into Neuroscience Grad School" literature from others like
       <a href="https://lucyblogs.wordpress.com/2018/08/02/all-about-phd-applications/">Lucy Lai</a>,
       <a href="https://monicagatesblog.wordpress.com/2016/03/14/the-phd-application-post/">Vael Gates</a>, and
       <a href="https://oriolpavon.com/2016/12/22/tips-applying-for-a-phd/">Oriol Pav&#243;n</a> (each of whose
       blogposts I found to be immensely helpful in my own application process).
       I thought about what I could possibly add of value given that I've always been a
       relatively poor student, went to an undergrad few have heard of, and hadn't met
       an academic until college. But in this, I think, I might have some advice for
       those that find themselves in a similar situation and still desire to attend
        a good (even great) Ph.D. program in neuroscience. <br> <br>
        This post will be
        less prescriptive and more personal; it's meant to be an account of my
        experiences&#8212;failures and all&#8212;with as much honesty as possible.
    </p>


    <h1 class="pb-3 mb-4 font-italic border-bottom">
         Should You Even Go to Grad School?
       </h1>
       Coming from a small liberal arts college, I always assumed that if you got your Ph.D., you could become a professor. I believed this largely because this is what was true
       when my professors were going to school and there were no postdocs or grad students around to tell me otherwise; how wrong I was! Before I dive into my application process, it's important to first
       get some facts about the odds regarding landing a tenure-tracked professorship.<br><br>

       <h4 class="pb-3 mb-4 font-italic border-bottom">
            Getting a tenured professorship is extremely difficult
        </h4>
      "Life of the Mind!" they tell you as an undergraduate and what could be better than spending your days pushing back the boundaries of human knowledge?
      What they don't tell you is that very very few students
      who enter a Ph.D. program, ever become a tenured professor. It's very difficult to get any exactitude regarding how many students end up as faculty although
      some have <a href="https://www.ascb.org/careers/where-will-a-biology-phd-take-you/">tried</a>.
      The number that's thrown around for neuroscience currently is 7%.
      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you make it to a competitive summer school (say with 50% acceptance rate), what do you think is the probability that you will end up being professor? I believe baseline of PhD-&gt; prof=7%</p>&mdash; KordingLab (@KordingLab) <a href="https://twitter.com/KordingLab/status/1161018973078642690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
      This number isn't the same for every school! Go to a top school and your chances aren't too shabby.
      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Follow-up for neuroscience PhD programs, specifically:<br><br>Here&#39;s UPenn&#39;s Neuroscience program as one example (n=60+). Similar data exists for UW, UCSF, and UNC. Across these four programs, ~31% of grads are in TT roles 10 years post-PhD.<br><br>The numbers &amp; data: <a href="https://t.co/sazAoJlaSM">https://t.co/sazAoJlaSM</a> <a href="https://t.co/Z8wr07FIxd">pic.twitter.com/Z8wr07FIxd</a></p>&mdash; ashley juavinett (@analog_ashley) <a href="https://twitter.com/analog_ashley/status/1161760088769515520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
      But it seems like, if other fields are any indication, that these top schools are supplying the great majority
      of faculty members. In fact, one <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/1/e1400005">study</a> found that graduates from approximately the top 10% of institutions filled around half of all faculty positions; the top 20% filled 75% of the available positons; and the top 50% filled around 95% of positions.
      On a personal note, this is why it was so important to me that I had alternatives should Academia no longer be an option. I made it a priority to get my masters degree in Applied Math which opens up the option of a career in data science.

      <h4 class="pb-3 mb-4 font-italic border-bottom">
           Publish or perish is real
       </h4>
      You must not only be very productive during the 5-7 years you are in grad school and 2-7 years you are a postdoc, you must also publish often and in the <i>right</i> journals.
       <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here are the funding and publication records of 61 new faculty in the life sciences who started labs at 21 large public R1 universities in 2018-2019. 36% have a first-author CNS paper, 75% have published in a CNS-family journal, and 16% have a K99. <a href="https://t.co/IHsbn4UsJl">pic.twitter.com/IHsbn4UsJl</a></p>&mdash; Jason Sheltzer (@JSheltzer) <a href="https://twitter.com/JSheltzer/status/1140671289277001730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
       The top journals, called CNS (Cell, Nature, and Science), are disproportinately represented and most new faculty have published in the CNS-family. These results were also mirrored in a study <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(14)00477-1"> here</a> which finds that "whether or not a scientist becomes a PI is largely predictable by their publication record, even taking into account the first few years of publication".
